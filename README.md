# Surface-Weather
A a simple, minimal, Material You inspired weather app, made using purley Python, via KivyMD for Android (and Windows, soon))

# This is the V1
and there are some known errors and areas of possible improvements, which will be fixed in the next iterations

============================

# Use:

To use city lookup and check weather in other locations, simply press or click on the current city text to enter the search menu, and to select a city from the menu, simply press on its main text / name

The app features dark / light theme selection, color palette selection, a current weather page and a forecast page, showing 3 hours of each day for the following few days

============================

# Notes:

The app uses MET Norway for weather data (updates once on boot), the simplemaps offline city database and the IP-API for geolocation (updates once on boot)

===========================

# Changelog:

# v1.3:
Added a new navbar, placed current weather in a BoxLayout for more consistency

# v1.1:
Edited scaling code, widget layout switching should now be more consistent. Utilities have been moved to a seperate file

# v1:
first release
